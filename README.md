# LaundryApp
So, for now, the plan is the following:

laundrytimesheet --> This package contains classes that will control the logic of the app.

listeners(will be added)--> Contains all action listeners for gui (FBI.exe not included).

gui -->  Contains classes that will display the pages to the user.

database --> Stores all of the users's private information in indivdual files.


resources --> This contains the images, sounds, (classified information from ALIENS) and other media that will be used in the gui.
